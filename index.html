                    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. <br>
                     For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. <br>
                     As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    <h3>Breaking apart an HTML element</h3>
                    <p>Let's explore this <b>paragraph</b> element a bit further.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <img src="p.jpg" alt="p element" style="width: 500px;">
                        <h3>The main parts of our element are as follows:</h3>
                        <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. <br>
                            This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                        <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. <br>
                            This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. <br>
                            Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                        <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                        <li><b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
                        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                        <img src="p+a.jpg" alt="p element" style="width: 500px;">
                        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. <br>
                            Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. <br>
                            The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things. <br>
                            Some attributes have no value, such as required.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
                            <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                            <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                            <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <h3>Anatomy of an HTML document</h3>
                    <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page.</p>
                    <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
                    <li><strong>!DOCTYPE html</strong> — doctype. It is a required preamble. <br>
                        In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. <br> 
                        However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
                    <li><strong>html /html</strong> — the <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. <br>
                        It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
                    <li><strong>head /head</strong> — the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. <br>
                        This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
                    <li><strong>meta charset="utf-8"</strong> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. <br>
                        Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
                    <li><strong>meta name="viewport"</strong> content="width=device-width" — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
                    <li><strong>title /title</strong> — the title element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. <br>
                        It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
                    <li><strong>body /body</strong> — the body element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    <h3 id="images">Images</h3>
                    <p>Let's turn our attention to the img element</p>
                    <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file. <br>
                    We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
                        <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. <br> 
                        If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. <br> 
                        In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth. <br><br>
                        Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.</p>
                    <img src="img.jpg" alt="img">

                    <h3>Marking up text</h3>
                    <p>This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Headings</h3>
                    <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. <br>
                       In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, h1 - h6, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h1> h1 - Should be the main heading.</h1></li>
                        <li><h2> h2 - it is a top heading.</h2></li>
                        <li><h3> h3 - usualy it is used for subheading</h3></li>
                        <li><h4> h4 - often used as a sub-subheading</h4></li>
                        <li><h5> h5 - it is smaller and not that often used</h5></li>
                        <li><h6> as h5, h6 it is not often used. </h6></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
                    <p>As explained above, "p" elements are for containing paragraphs of text; <br>
                        you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content</p>
                    <img src="isap.jpg" alt="p element" style="width: 500px;">
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li id="list">
                    <h3>Lists</h3>
                    <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. <br>
                        Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. <br>
                        The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Unordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. <br>
                            These are wrapped in a ul element.</li>
                        <img src="ul.jpg" alt="Unordered list" style="width: 250px;">
                        <li><b>Ordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. <br>
                            These are wrapped in an ol element.</li>
                        <img src="ol.jpg" alt="Ordered list" style="width: 250px;">
                    </ol>
                    <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an "li" (list item) element.</p>
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li id="table">
                    <h3>Tables</h3>
                    <p>A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns.</p>
                    <img src="table.jpg" alt="table" style="width:250px;">
                    <table>

                <li id="link">
                    <h3>Links</h3>
                    <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! <br>
                        To add a link, we need to use a simple element "a" being the short form for "anchor".</p>
